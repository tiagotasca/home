## Welcome to My Academic Website

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Politics Department. My research explores the subnational variation of healthcare outcomes in Latin America, particularly in Brazil. I am specifically interested in the interplay between belief in misinformation, institutional trust, political ideology, and state capacity to provide social policies at the local level. I explore these themes using a mixed-methods strategy with interviews, experimental survey designs, and quantitative analysis.
